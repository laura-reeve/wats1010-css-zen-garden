CSS Zen Garden 

I am currently taking Eddie Salazar's Zen Meditation Class on campus, so I want to incorporate those ideas into this website.  Zen is about calm breath and mind, flow, neutrality, peaceful awareness, the environment...


Overall Concept and Theme

Color Scheme: Pastel Zen Garden

Water Blue: rgb (53,179,214);
Stone Gray: rgb(108,140,138);
Leaf Green: rgb(107,204,127);
Cherry Blossom Pink: rgb(255,175,211);
Sand: rgb(204,193,171);

I want to recreate the meditative feeling of being present in a zen garden.  I may use some nature images, but I really wanted to create the feeling of a garden with color and peaceful balance between content blocks.  

I did have this idea of creating stones that move slightly when hovered over for the aside lists, but that may require incorporating more natural elements.  Maybe the button shape and color could resemble stone.  

I also don't want for it to be too busy... I like the idea of have a sand color as the background, with the other colors providing content on the page.  Or maybe I could use background color gradiants to turn sand to water to green, etc.  And change the fonts colors appropriately.  

I want to keep the design as responsive as possible.  I'm not sure how flowy I can get with animations, but I don't want any hard edges or abrupt changes, I want for elements to flow into one another.  More curves, rounded boxes.  If I could somehow create that swirling rake effect, that would be super cool. 

Moving image thoughts: a flame, running water, blowing leaves/cherry blossoms...

Element Breakdown:
Title, supporting paragraph, 5 main content blocks, footer, 3 aside ul link blocks (1 nav)



How I hope to impact/affect the user:
I'm hoping to provide a pleasing design that is also calming.  I would like for the user to meander down the page, but not feel overwhelmed by too many elements.  I would like to incorporate a background image of the rake that is centered near the circle of open space in the middle, almost as if the reader's eyes are a rake that combs over the page any way they would like to read it.  


Links that I have looked at:

http://www.csszengarden.com/ - I like the color and gradiants in the Verde Moderna design
http://www.csszengarden.com/174/ - Simple - I like the simplicity, just a reminder that I don't have to go nuts
http://www.csszengarden.com/184/ - Peace of Mind - feels like a spa website, this is the feeling I want to convey
